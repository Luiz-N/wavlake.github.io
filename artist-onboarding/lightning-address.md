# Lightning Address

[Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com/) is an experimental way to use simple, human-readable addresses that look like email addresses to receive Lightning payments. For example, someone could use an address such as "ok@computer.com" and get tips to a wallet connected to that address. There is some clever orchestration happening behind the scenes using the LNURL payment request protocol, but this is all invisible to the end user.

Artists can register a Lightning address to Wavlake and receive tips to that address. However, the site will take a small fee to cover costs and maintenance for the service. More details are available on the [Mechanics](../mechanics.md#fees) page.

There are no fees for artists using their own Lightning nodes.
