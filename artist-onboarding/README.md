# Artist Onboarding

The following pages describe how to connect to Wavlake so you can start listing tracks and collecting sats. The two main ways are 1) using your own LND node or 2) using a Lightning address. While the connection instructions for LND nodes are specific to certain OS's/services, the steps generally apply to most LND setups and can be readily adapted. We will add more guides as more artists connect with various node types.

Once you are connected to the site, consider [opening a channel](../connect.md) to the Wavlake Lightning node to help route payments to your node.

Artists are also required to sign a copy of our [License Agreement](../license-agreement.md) before uploading tracks.

If you come across an issue, please reach out at contact@wavlake.com
