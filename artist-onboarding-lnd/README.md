# Artist Onboarding (LND)

The following pages describe how to connect your LND node to Wavlake so you can start listing tracks and collecting sats. While the instructions are specific to certain OS's/services, the steps generally apply to most LND setups and can be readily adapted.

Once you are connected to the site, consider [opening a channel](../connect.md) to the Wavlake Lightning node to help route payments to your node.

If you come across an issue, please reach out at contact@wavlake.com
