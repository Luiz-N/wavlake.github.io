# About Us

Wavlake is a Bitcoin-powered music platform that allows artists to receive direct payments from listeners using the Lightning Network.

Tracks on the homepage are ranked according to the number of plays and the number of tips it has received. Users who like a song and want to support the artist can send a tip directly to the artist with a Lightning payment. This not only helps pay for the music but also boosts the track's ranking on the site.
